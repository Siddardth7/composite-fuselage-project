# Composite Fuselage Project

**Objective**  
Design, manufacture, and test a 24” E-glass/Nomex composite fuselage section for SAMPE.

## Overview
Analytical modeling (CLT) + ABAQUS FEM + full-scale experimental validation.

## Key Results
- 38% deflection reduction after laminate optimization.  
- 2591 lbf at 1” deflection (≥150% of design load).  
- ±2 mm dimensional accuracy after 275°F, 40 psi, 90 min autoclave cure.

## Methods
- **CLT + Tsai-Wu** for sizing.  
- **ABAQUS** shell model for stiffness and failure checks.  
- **Manufacturing**: 7781 E-glass prepreg, 32% RC, Nomex 48 kg/m³ core, vacuum bag + autoclave.  
- **Testing**: three-point bend, load–deflection capture and FEM comparison.
